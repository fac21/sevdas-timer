# sevdas-timer

## Pre-course 4 Mini-project

This week we are building pomodoro which is a time management technique made out of spaced repetition system. Do the work, take a break.

Every 3 repetitions will create a set. After each set we will take a long break.
We will also set a daily goal of 12 repetiitons to hit the highest productivity level!
The timer will count down to zero and once it hits zero the bell feature will ring to notify us either to take a break or to get focused.

- I used viewport units to set the color to the full browser height and width so the size is based on the users entire viewport.
