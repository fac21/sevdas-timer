# sevdas-timer

## Pre-course 4 Mini-project

This week we are building pomodoro which is a time management technique made out of spaced repetition system. Do the work, take a break.

Every 3 repetitions will create a set. After each set we will take a long break.
We will also set a daily goal of 12 repetiitons to hit the maximum productivity level!
The timer will count down to zero and once it hits zero the bell feature will ring to notify the user either to take a break or to get focused.

- To display / manipulate inner texts I used `.textContent` property after watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UsllDMhvN4)explaining how does it allows user input on the webpage.
